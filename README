This is a simple web-based CMS that uses text files and templates to publish articles.

How to install:

Drop into a directory on a web server.
You will also need a 'content' dir and a 'templates' dir somewhere.

How to use:

Include and instantiate the Publisher class, passing it the absolute paths
to the content and template dirs, respectively.

You can then call Publisher->renderArticle, passing it the webroot and a route.
The web root is the base URI you would like to use for your articles,
and the route is the rest of the URI for a particular article,
determined by the location of the article in your content dir.

The workings of the content and template dirs are similar to that of the
Stacey CMS, at http://staceyapp.com, with a few custom features.
